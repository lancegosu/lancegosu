### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer interning at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Radical AI](https://lab.radicalai.app/), where I'm building and evaluating AI systems.
I graduated from San Jose State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology, and I'm currently taking a course from Illinois Tech to learn about Open Source Operating Systems.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect and talk about software!
