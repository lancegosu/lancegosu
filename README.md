### 👋 Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer interning at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Radical AI](https://lab.radicalai.app/), where I'm building and evaluating AI systems.
I graduated from San Jose State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology, and I'm currently enrolled in two online courses to earn certifications:
- Illinois Tech: Intro to Open Source Operating Systems
- University of Alberta: Software Design and Architecture

💬 Let's connect and talk about software or anything!
