### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer who builds and evaluates AI systems at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Radical AI](https://lab.radicalai.app/).
I graduated from San Jose State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology, and I'm currently in progress to earn two certifications to have a stronger background in computer science:
- Illinois Tech: Intro to Open Source Operating Systems by Jeremy Hajek
- University of Alberta: Software Design and Architecture by Kenny Wong

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect and talk about software or anything!
