### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer currently building and evaluating AI systems at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Reality AI](https://www.realityai.tech/).

Originally from a healthcare background, my journey into tech was driven by a desire to continue helping people, this time through software development. Iâ€™m passionate about creating innovative solutions that can improve lives and enhance the user experience.

Beyond tech, I'm a dedicated tennis coach, training students of all ages and skill levels. My coaching philosophy focuses on personalized development - helping athletes become the best versions of themselves both on and off the court.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect to explore opportunities for collaboration and growth!
