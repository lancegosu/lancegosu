### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer currently building and evaluating AI systems at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Radical AI](https://lab.radicalai.app/).

My career began in healthcare with a desire to help people directly. Transitioning to technology, I maintained this core value and discovered a passion for developing applications that improve lives and address practical challenges.

In addition to my tech career, I am also a dedicated tennis coach, successfully training hundreds of students of all ages and skill levels. My coaching philosophy focuses on personalized development and fostering a love for the game.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect to discuss software, AI, or our shared interests!
