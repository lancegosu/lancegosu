### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hey, I'm Lance, a self-taught software engineer currently building and evaluating AI systems at two startups, [Cyber Partner AI](https://cyberpartnerai.com/) and [Radical AI](https://lab.radicalai.app/).

My career began in healthcare with a desire to help people directly. Maintaining this core value, I discovered a passion for software development to continue to improve lives and also enhance the user experience.

Beyond tech, I'm a dedicated tennis coach training students of all ages and skill levels. My coaching philosophy focuses on personalized development and becoming a better athlete overall.
